Boss-Shop was originally an open sourced plugin which I modified to suit the needs of the server.
The remaining was fully written by me.

Original server file is 21GB so unfortunately no option of hosting, though a world download of the server is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iVNM8Tf0gdxZl25KFgK-e46US1wehDOS/view?usp=sharing .

If you are interested, the patch notes history of the server can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMEqCS0SuP4u7qCUwNr4EZB4S1jNcFUkg5qNm04jy4o
